# Master

This repository contains all files used during my master thesis. Files used for running the NEST software remotely on supercomputers with a varied choice of variables, and different choices of models used to represent the neural system. One can also see different statistical analysis of the properties of the various models in the jupyter notebooks. 

In the folder microcircuit you will find the files used to run the simulation using the Microcircuit model to represent the neural system. The difference between the microcircuit and the continuous_microcircuit folders, is that in the continuous_microcircuit folder, we retrieve the delay values in the spike times from a continuous interval.

There are several files with the prefix brunel, these files are generating spike data for the neural system represented by the Brunel model.
